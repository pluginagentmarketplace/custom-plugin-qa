# QA Fundamentals & Methodologies

## Quick Start

QA fundamentals cover:
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, E2E, regression, UAT
- **Methodologies**: Waterfall, Agile, DevOps
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect density, test coverage, escape rate
- **Best Practices**: Documentation, traceability, test planning

## Test Types

### Unit Testing
- Individual component testing
- Developer responsibility
- Fast execution
- High coverage target (80%+)

### Integration Testing
- Multiple components
- Component interaction
- API testing
- Database testing

### System Testing
- End-to-end scenarios
- System behavior
- Performance
- Security

### UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- Real-world scenarios
- User involvement
- Business validation
- Sign-off

### Regression Testing
- Verify existing functionality
- After changes/updates
- Automated tests preferred
- Full suite execution

## QA Methodologies

### Waterfall QA
- Sequential testing
- Test phase after development
- Comprehensive planning
- Documentation focused

### Agile QA
- Continuous testing
- Parallel with development
- Short cycles (sprints)
- Automation focused

### DevOps QA
- Continuous integration/testing
- Automated pipelines
- Shift-left testing
- Real-time feedback

## Quality Metrics

### Coverage Metrics
- Line coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function coverage
- Statement coverage

### Defect Metrics
- Defect density
- Escape rate
- Severity distribution
- Mean time to fix

### Process Metrics
- Test execution rate
- Pass/fail ratio
- Test case effectiveness
- Automation percentage

## Best Practices

✅ Clear test objectives
✅ Complete documentation
✅ Traceability matrix
✅ Test environment setup
✅ Test data management
✅ Regular monitoring
✅ Continuous improvement
