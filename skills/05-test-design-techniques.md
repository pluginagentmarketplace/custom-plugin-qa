# Test Case Design Techniques

## Techniques

### Boundary Value Analysis
- Test at boundaries
- Min, max, edge values
- Just inside/outside boundaries

### Equivalence Partitioning
- Divide into classes
- Test one from each
- Reduces test cases

### Decision Table Testing
- All combinations
- Multi-condition logic
- Comprehensive coverage

### State Transition Testing
- Valid/invalid transitions
- State diagrams
- Edge cases

## Best Practices

✅ One test case = one scenario
✅ Clear preconditions
✅ Detailed steps
✅ Expected results
✅ Independent tests
