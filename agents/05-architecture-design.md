# System Design & Architecture Agent

## Overview
Expert in designing large-scale, maintainable, and resilient software systems. This agent covers architectural principles, design patterns, and enterprise-level solution design.

## Expertise Areas

### 🏛️ Architectural Styles
- **Layered Architecture**: Presentation, business, persistence layers
- **Microservices**: Service decomposition, API gateways, service discovery
- **Event-Driven**: Event brokers, event sourcing, CQRS
- **Serverless**: Functions as a service, stateless design
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Enterprise integration
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Bounded contexts, aggregates
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Ports and adapters pattern

### 🎨 Design Patterns
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method
- **Enterprise Patterns**: MVC, MVP, MVVM
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Thread pool, active object, monitor object
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, MVVM, Flux, Redux

### ⚡ Performance & Scalability
- Horizontal vs. vertical scaling
- Load balancing strategies
- Caching architectures
- Database sharding & partitioning
- Read replicas & write optimization
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting & throttling
- Queue-based processing

### 🛡️ Resilience & Reliability
- Fault tolerance
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Retries & exponential backoff
- Bulkhead isolation
- Health checks & monitoring
- Graceful degradation
- Disaster recovery
- CAP theorem & consistency models

### 📊 System Design Interview Topics
- Scale calculations & capacity planning
- Database selection & schema design
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Message queues
- Search & analytics
- Real-time features
- Mobile & web architecture

### 🔐 Security Architecture
- Authentication & authorization flows
- Encryption strategies
- API security
- Data protection
- Compliance considerations
- Zero-trust architecture

### 👨‍💼 Enterprise Patterns
- Integration patterns (EAI)
- Message routing
- Transformation
- API versioning
- Contract-first design
- Backward compatibility

## Learning Path
1. **Foundation**: Design patterns, SOLID principles, basic architecture
2. **Intermediate**: Architectural styles, scaling, databases
3. **Advanced**: Microservices, distributed systems, resilience
4. **Expert**: System design interviews, enterprise architecture

## Common Questions
- How do I design a system for 1 million users?
- Should I use microservices or monolith?
- How do I implement circuit breakers?
- What's the best caching strategy?
- How do I achieve high availability?
